# Cards-Of-Fate
Cards of Fate is a simple card game where 2 players take turns choosing cards and adding up their values to the score.
Based on the positive or negative score value at the end of the game, only one player can win.
All the cards and their values are randomly generated, so every game has a different outcome for final values.

## Rules
Each player takes a turn flipping over a card on the board.
Black cards add their values to the score and Red cards subtract their values to the score.
If a flipped card is inverted, the value of the card is also reversed.
In that case, Black cards subtract their values and Red cards add their values.
Once a certain number of cards has been flipped, whether the final score is positive or negative determines
which player wins.
The Joker card is also involved in this game. Flipping over the Joker card automatically wins the game for the player. However, flipping over an inverted Joker card automatically loses the game instead.
