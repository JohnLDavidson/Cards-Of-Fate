# Cards-Of-Fate
Cards of Fate is a simple card game where players take turns choosing cards and adding up their values to the score.
Based on the positive or negative score value at the end of the game, only one player can win.
All the cards and their values are randomly generated, so every game has a different outcome for final values.
